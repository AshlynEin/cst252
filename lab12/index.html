	<h1> Lab Summary </h1>
	<p> This lab involved utilizing loops in Javascript in order to display numerical values and values that replaced numerical values. </p>
	<h2> Challenges </h2>
	<p> We had a lot of difficulty completing this lab. The hard part was not impleting the script to convert number values to words. Rather, the difficulty was trying to get it to display on our webpages. I still was unable to get it to properly display. </p>
	<h3> Results </h3>
	<p> I was unable to complete all tasks of the lab. </p>
