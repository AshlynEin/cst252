	<h1> Lab Summary </h1>
	<p> This lab involved working with Javascript functions and input forms within our webpages.</p>
	<h2> Challenges </h2>
	<p> We had a lot of struggles in completing this lab. We didn't really have a large number of issues, like we may have in previous labs, but 
		rather one large issue. We had difficulty in figuring out how we were meant to link the input function that we utilized in this lab, with the sort function we utilized 
		in lab 7. We knew how each function worked and operated separately, but we had troubles figuring out how to link the two together. We consulted with the lecture notes, 
		tried looking at information on w3schools, and consulted with multiple peers, to no avail. Luckily, my partner has a friend who took the course previously, and she was able to
	provide us with insight and code, which allowed us to complete the lab. </p>
	<h3> Results </h3>
   <p> We were able to complete the lab successfully. </p>
