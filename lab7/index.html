	<h1> Lab Summary</h1>
	<p> In this lab, me and my partner followed the task list in order to impletement JavaScript functions into our skillset. We worked together to create responsive popup boxes that generated a scrambled result based on the input.</p>
	
    <h2> Challenges </h2>
    <p> We found that we had some difficulties in correctly implementing our functions; we had some typo errors that were affecting our output. We both reviewed with each other, and the lecture notes, and quickly solved the issues.</p>

    <h3> Results </h3>
    <p> We were able to complete the tasks successfully. </p>
