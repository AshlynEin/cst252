	<h1> Lab Summary </h1>
	<p> This lab was overall simple to complete. I found it to be another much needed refresher on HTML and CSS, which I feel will help me prepare better for the rest of the course. </p>
	<h2> Challenges </h2>
	<p> I found that my only challenge in this lab was some image re-sizing issues regarding my homepage. After a few tries, and some assistance from my partner, I re-sized the image to my desired size. Overall, I found the lab to be an easy refresher. </p>
	<h3> Results </h3>
	<p> I found that my partner and I were able to complete the lab with little to no difficulty. </p>
