<h1> Lab Summary </h1>
<p> This lab is comprised of utilizing Ajax as a data retrieval tool in conjugation with jQuery, as well as using APIS. </p>
<h2> Challenges </h2>
<p> Me and my partner couldn't figure out the API and it's 12:44am at the time of writing this and I don't even want to hear about time management. We're using Wes's code. We can fix it later. </p>
<h3> Results </h3>
<p> We were able to get the lab to work successfully.</p>
