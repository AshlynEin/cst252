	<h1> Lab Summary </h1>
	<p> In this lab, me and my partner reviewed our previous Javascript files in previous labs. We never faced any major issues in our codes that prevented us from completing the tasks of the lab. If we had any issues, we solved them as we were working. Regardless, we thought it would be beneficial for practice purposes that we add a debugging tag to our previous labs. </p>
	<h2> Challenges </h2>
	<p> We had no challenges in completing this lab, as we just had to add a debugger to our Javascript code and not really problem solve. </p>
	<h3> Results </h3>
	<p> We completed the lab successfully. </p>
