	<h1> Lab Summary </h1>
	<p> This lab consisted of utilizing conditionals, known as "if, else, and if else" statements. It allows us to create functions with multiple outcomes, in this case, based on the inputs from the user. </p>
	<h2> Challenges </h2>
	<p> As we had screenshots to reference, we found that we had no challenges in completing the main portion of the lab. We did face challenges in completing the bonus tasks, so we decided to skip it for now. </p>
	<h3> Results </h3>
	<p> We were able to complete the lab successfully. </p>
