<header> Lab Summary </header>
<p> Me and my partner practiced psuedocoding throughout this lab to familarize ourselves with Javascript principles. We psuedocoded a everyday task and a computer task in order to pratice different models of thinking. </p>
<header> Challenges </header>
<p> Me and my partner faced some challenges in the pseudocoding in terms of finding the correct phrasing in our 'code'. We wanted to be clear in our phrasing, but not too specific in our model. Our other primary challenge was connection issues in Atom. Several times either myself or my partner's connections timed out for seemingly no reason in Atom. Luckily we both were communicating via Zoom, so we were always aware of what was happening. </p>
<header> Results </header>
<p> We were able to complete the lab tasks successfully. </p>
