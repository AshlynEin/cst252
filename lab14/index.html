<h1> Lab Summary </h1>
<p> This lab comprised of us utilizing classes and objects in Javascript in order to create an object based on our vehicle(s). </p>
<h2> Challenges </h2>
<p> At first I had issues getting my Javascript results to display on my HTML page. I tried commenting out my code and running my code by my partner and trying a peer's code (Val Ramirez), in case it was issues with my code. Utimately, my issue  was with my script source defer.</p>
<h3> Results </h3>
<p> Me and my partner were able to complete the lab successfully. </p>
