		<h1> Lab Summary </h1>
		<p> This lab was composed of assigning and creating elements based on the DOM hiearchy, as well as utilizing CSS Styling principles directly in our Javascript file.</p>
		<h2> Challenges </h2>
		<p> My primary challenge was involving the New ELements that we created as a part of our task list. I had issues with getting my newly created elements to display on my final page. By working with my partner, 
		and going back to the lecture slides for reference, I found that my problems were : improper placement of output codes in my Javascript file, and typos (capitalization, forgotten semi-colons, etc.)</p>
		<h3> Results </h3>
		<p> Me and my partner completed the lab tasks successfully. </p>
